# Format of a PUP scene line:
#
#  1: PUP trigger source (D - DMD, W - Switch, S - Solenoid, L - Light),
#  2: PUP trigger ID,
#  3: PUP trigger value,
#  4: number of frames,
#  5: duration of each frame,
#  6: 0 - not interruptable, 1 - interruptable by frame match or PUP trigger
#  7: 0 - start immediately, replacing triggering frame, 1 - start after frame duration (see 5)
#  8: 0 - play once, 1 - loop, >= 2 - repeat x times
#  9: 0 - no frame groups, >= 2 - create x frame groups (you get x times the number of frames entered in 2 to play changing scenes)
# 10: 0 - play frame group in order, 1 - play random frame group
# 11: 0 - no autostart, >= 1 - start this scene after x seconds of inactivity (no new frames), only use once, could be combined with frame groups
# 12: 0 - when scene is finished, show last frame of the scene until a new frame is matched, 1 - black screen, 2 - show last frame before scene started
#
# Postions 4 - 10 are optional. If not provided, the default is 0.

# Scene 60001
D,60001,1,38,16

# Scene 61479, interruptable
D,61479,1,52,20,1

# Scene 63500, interruptable, starting delayed by frame duration, loop
D,63500,1,40,20,1,1,1

# Scene 63511, interruptable, starting delayed by frame duration, play once, 3 frame groups
# This will generate 3 groups of 75 frames, so 225 frames in total.
# Every time the PUP ID 63511 get triggered, only one of the three groups gets played (75 frames).
# First occurrence of the PUP ID will play group 1, the second group 2. After the third group, it will start again with group 1.
D,63511,1,75,20,1,1,0,3

# This will generate 4 groups of 200 frames, so 800 frames in total.
# If no frame is matched for 5 seconds, randomly one of the 4 groups gets played once.
# When the 100 frames of the scene ended, the previous original frame will be shown.
# The internal timer gets reseted and after 5 more seconds of inactivity, another group of 100 frames gets randomly played
#
# This way an attract mode for early electronic games with segment displays can be implemented.
# Normally, the last scores are shown until someone starts a new game.
# Now the scores are displayed for 5 seconds, than a random short video scene out of four gets played for 4 seconds.
# Then the scores are shown again and so on until someone starts a game.
